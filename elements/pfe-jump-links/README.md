# PatternFly Element | Jump links element


## Usage
This component is focused on reading content inside the <pfe-jump-links-panel> and updating a sidebar or horizontal nav to indicate the section of the document currently being viewed. As a developer, you have the choice of whether you bring your own markup to the nav, or have the nav build a DOM tree for you. Please note the shape of the DOM tree below. In order to support sub-section highlighting jump links must be very opinionated about the DOM tree.

Inside of <pfe-jump-links-panel> add the class .pfe-jump-links-panel__section to tell the component to watch for when that section crosses the scroll threshold. If this section has sub-sections you add the class .has-sub-section to the section parent (i.e. section 8) and add .sub-section to the child sections (i.e. 8.1). Make sure to add an id to each section, this id should match to the href attribute of the corresponding <a> tag.

## Wiring up the nav
The panel and nav are wired up by a scrolltarget and id. On the panel add an attribute scrolltarget="foo". This will correspond to the nav's #id. Add the corresponding id to your nav like so id="foo". The last step is to match the <a> tag's href attribute to specific sections (just like you would with same page anchor links). See below for a simple example with three sections where section two has two sub-sections:

```html
<pfe-jump-links-nav id="jumplinks1" default>
    <h4 slot="pfe-jump-links-nav--heading">Jump to section</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="#section1">Section 1</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#section2">Section 2</a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#section2.1">Section 2.1</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                <a href="#section2.2">Section 2.2</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#section3">Section 3</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</pfe-jump-links-nav>
...
<pfe-jump-links-panel scrolltarget="jumplinks1">
    <h2 class="pfe-jump-links-panel__section" id="section1">Section 1</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
    <h2 class="pfe-jump-links-panel__section has-sub-section" id="section2">Section 2</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
    <h2 class="pfe-jump-links-panel__section sub-section" id="section2">Section 2.1</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
    <h2 class="pfe-jump-links-panel__section sub-section" id="section2">Section 2.2</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
    <h2 class="pfe-jump-links-panel__section" id="section2">Section 2</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
</pfe-jump-links-panel>
```

### Accessibility
The template and DOM structure of this component are as follows:
```html
<nav>
  <h2 hidden>Page navigation</h2> // this is visually hidden
  <h4>Slotted content</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a>Regular list item</a></li>
    <li><a>List item with sub sections</a></li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><a>Nested sub section</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

No extra roles or aria labels are required because we're using standard html tags in their prescribed uses.

## Slots


- `pfe-jump-links-nav--heading`:  The rest of the component works by creating a mirror shadowRoot based on the Light DOM markup. 


## Attributes


- `autobuild`: Flips the switch on the component to create its own markup for the navigation. You can add `pfe-jump-links-panel__section` to each section that should show in the nav. If you want to use sub-sections add `has-sub-section` to the parent section that should always show and the `sub-section` class to the children of that section. If you use this attribute, keep in mind that non-JavaScript environments (some search engines, browsers with JS disabled) will not see the proper markup.

- `sr-text`: This attribute is read when the component upgrades to provide the innerText of the heading. If there is no `sr-text` attribute then the component defaults to "JUMP TO SECTION". This attribute is to enable translations and internationalization.

- `offset`: This attribute determines the distance from the top of the browser window to trigger a switch from one link being active to the next. For instance `offset="600"` would mean that threshold flips at 600px from the top. The default is set at 200, and if you desire 200px then you can leave this attribute off. The `offset` attribute should be placed on `pfe-jump-links-panel`. There is a css solution to control the offset, however the attribute value takes precedence over css. To read more about a css solution see below.

- `style="--pfe-jump-links-panel--offset: {integer};"`: You can control offset in your styling layer as well. This value can be set directly on the component inside a style attribute, e.g. `style="--pfe-jump-links-panel--offset: 100;"` or using the appropriate selector in another file. Please note that adding an attribute will take precedence over a css value. At the moment only integer values passed to this key are valid. No other values are supported. This means that passing "300px", "2rem","calc(100% - 12px)" will all result in JavaScript errors. You should pass a number that correlates to pixels. To read about the `offset` attribute, see above.

- `style="--pfe-jump-links-panel__section--spacer: {integer}{unit};"`: pfe-jump-links are built with native behavior in terms of anchor links and scroll. That means that clicking a nav link will adjust the viewport to show the top of that section aligned with the top of the browser. This native browser is undesirable in certain cases such as working with a "sticky" navigation bar or other elements placed outside of the normal document flow. The panel components inserts a "spacer" just before each section that can be manipulated with this custom property. Specify a unit along with an integer like so: `--pfe-jump-links-panel__section--spacer: 100px;`.

## Events
This component fires an event when a link is made active.

## Code style

Jump links (and all PFElements) use [Prettier][prettier] to auto-format JS and JSON. The style rules get applied when you commit a change. If you choose to, you can [integrate your editor][prettier-ed] with Prettier to have the style rules applied on every save.
